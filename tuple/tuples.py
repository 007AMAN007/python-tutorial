#A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. 
#In Python tuples are written with round brackets
#means tuple is same as that of list but we can't change tuple
x=(1,2,3)
print(x[2])
#LEFT ALL THINGS ARE SAME AS THAT OF LIST
#FOR CHANGE VALUE OF TUPLE WE HAVE TO FIRST CONVERT IT INTO LIST WITH TYPECAST
